# Algorithm

1. Initialize a Matplotlib figure with a 2x3 grid of subplots.
2. Generate a Complete Graph with 6 nodes using `nx.complete_graph()` and draw it using `nx.circular_layout()`.
3. Generate a Cycle Graph with 8 nodes using `nx.cycle_graph()` and draw it using `nx.circular_layout()`.
4. Generate a Complete Bipartite Graph with partitions of size 3 and 4 using `nx.complete_bipartite_graph()` and draw it using `nx.bipartite_layout()`.
5. Generate a Wheel Graph with 6 nodes using `nx.wheel_graph()` and draw it by manually computing circular coordinates for the rim nodes around the central node.
6. Generate a Path Graph with 5 nodes using `nx.path_graph()` and draw it horizontally.
7. Generate a Null Graph with 5 nodes using `nx.empty_graph()` and draw it horizontally.
8. Render all subplots to the screen.
